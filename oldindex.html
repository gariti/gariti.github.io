    <h2>about me</h2>
    <p>I have always been interested in technology since I was a little kid.  To me a computer was just a toy that can be used for fun.  I always fiddled with my settings on the machine to make it my own, which eventually led me to modifying my games and programs to work the way I wanted.  As an adult, I pursued my other interests such as travelling around the world and seeing how others live.  I have always been interested in cutting edge technologies to make life easier for people.  I think we are just at the beginning of this phase in technology.  A dream of mine would be to work on these kind of cutting edge projects.</p>

    <h2>experience</h2>
    <p>My first job was working in the factory for a fiber optics company, which was a very fascinating industry.  We actually built equipment used by NASA's Jet Propulsion Labratory.  Later, I was building electical and electronics equipment.  We built devices to make the home smarter and more energy efficient.  Finally, I got my first job in software development for a small company, which I did for about 3 years.</p>
